# DSPythonNet3

This project builds the DSPythonNet3 dynamo python engine package.

Building the project will output files in `package_output` that can be used to ship as a Dynamo package.

Builds are published to [Jenkins](https://master-5.jenkins.autodesk.com/job/Dynamo/job/DSPythonNet3/job/master/) for each commit to `master`.
